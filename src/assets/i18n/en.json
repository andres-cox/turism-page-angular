                "description": "In the upper part of Tarija, a remarkable architecture that shelters the Parish of San Roque stands out, a sanctuary where the most humble people attended, which is why, more than 400 years ago, the Franciscan religious established a small hermitage or chapel called San Roque. The Parish of San Roque is the epicenter of the largest festival in Tarija and is an emblem of the identity of the Tarijeños.</br> </br> San Roque was born in Montepellier; France on August 16, 1295 in a home of heroes of the French nobility, his parents were Don Juan de la Cruz and Doña Liberia; its nobility descended from the Christian Kings of France. His father was a wealthy governor of the city from which he inherited to his son all his fortune. On the death of his parents, he distributed his wealth to the poor, took the habit and the staff of the pilgrim and traveled to Italy, in whose territory the plague devastated its inhabitants, San Roque dedicated himself to the sick, restoring their health.</br></br>In 1900, the Franciscan father Buenaventura Lolli ordered the small bell towers to be demolished and the current elegant facade designed, which was completed by Father Vicente Picinini. The construction was started with the dome followed by the external walls to continue with the raising of the central columns to support the following floors and the roof of the temple itself.</br></br> Before the increasing number of faithful and for the spiritual benefit of the neighbors; The Mother Church of San Roque was segregated, erecting it as a Parish; installed by the Reverend Archbishop of La Plata, Fray Sebastián Francisco Pifferi of the Order of Friars Minor and Apostolic Missionary of the Franciscan Convent of Tarija. On October 27, 1907, it was given partially to Fr. Columbano Maria Puccetti of the Order of Friars Minor and Franciscan Apostolic Missionary, being the first pastor of the parish and who made improvements inside the temple. During the first decade of the 20th century, modifications were made to the facade of the temple with the current design.</br></br> Later, on July 16, 1956, the Parish was handed over for its custody and administration to the priests of the Carmelite Order, who received an experience of faith and identity of the people expressed in San Roque, who as a Christian left a mark in the life of the population that suffered from diseases."

Its peculiar architecture and style burst the view of the southern Bolivian city by abruptly contrasting with the brick buildings erected in its environs. <br/> <br/> Considered one of the precious stones of Tarija's heritage treasure, the facade of this nineteenth-century house looks like a brilliant sapphire; is the blue color of the Bolivian firmament. <br/> <br/> Its history is born with the fortune of Moisés Navajas, one of the wealthiest merchants in the region, who decided to build the castle for family about 150 years ago. Back then the residence was used as a country house because it was surrounded by a large park. The exquisite architectural work was designed by the Camponovo brothers who chose the European trend art noveau for its construction."

                "description": "Considered a National Monument, the colossal 'Casa Dorada' with 115 years since its construction, constitutes an exquisite architectural sample, right in the center of the 'Andalusian city'. <br/> <br/> Moisés Navajas Ichazo and Esperanza Morales Serrano, considered in their time the 'Millionaires of Tarija', were the pioners of the monumental work, in 1903. <br/> <br/> At the death of these citizens, who had no descendants, the work, plus the wealth it contained, passed to regional entities; instances from which the treasure was preserved. The historical explanation shows that on the back of a mule and along bridleways, the couple brought various products from Europe to supply 'la botica' (the pharmacy) that they had in their home, in addition to the furniture, rugs and curtains, which some of them they still conserve, while others had to be replaced by imitations, given the damage they suffered over time. <br/> <br/> The couple engaged in trade, imported agricultural material, glassware, ironmongery, food and confectionery that they sold in Argentine cities such as Salta, Tucumán and Córdoba. On their way to his native Tarija there were cities like Potosí and Sucre, where they also sold their items. <br/> <br/> Although the ground floor sector was intended to store the commerce that imported from Europe, in the private spaces of the house, such as the reception room, dining room and a private oratory (where you can appreciate on the ceiling, pictorial murals, which portray the 14 stations of the Way of the Cross of Jesus), an element that enhances the couple's devotion to the Catholic religion. You can also appreciate furniture and objects of unmatched quality such as: Venetian glass mirrors , fine-crystal chandeliers, damask and gobelin curtains, a red cedar piano, bronze sculptures, an opal centerpiece, and fine European-style furnishings, wallpaper walls, Persian rugs, which are all under plastic, in order to avoid deterioration, due to the number of tourists who visit the place daily. <br/> <br/> It is observed that the couple did not skimp in resources to request to form various samples of plastic art from that time, which still remain unchanged."
